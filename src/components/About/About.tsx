                    Since I first stepped off a train into London, Ontario in September 2021, I have been learning and growing as part of Westernâ€™s community. In my first year, I learned about independence. Like many students, I lived alone for the first time and had to figure out how to make friends in a new situation where I knew nobody.

                            In my second year, I learned about community. I began to find my place in the USC clubs system as a member in several clubs; and I worked to create my own - the Western Knit and Crochet Club (WKCC).

                            In my third year, I learned about leadership. At this point I was the Co-President of WKCC and the Vice-President Logistics of the UWO Debate Society, and people began to rely on me to ensure meetings, events, and travel ran smoothly and enjoyably.

                            Now, in my fourth year, I am learning about inspiration. Now, as a USC Councillor, the President of the UWO Debate Society, and a candidate for USC President, I have worked to use my platforms to inspire, connect, and uplift students.
